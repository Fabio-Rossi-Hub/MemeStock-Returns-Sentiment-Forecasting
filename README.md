# MemeStock-Sentiment-Forecasting
The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of sentiment on the meme stocks during the first months of 2021.
In particular we will try to assess the relationship of meme stocks return with the sentiment from Wallstreetbets subreddit.

This project is a github version of a local project created in 2021, which will be expandended with a study of volatility and a strategy backtesting.

Give me some time to migrate the project and I'll make everything more user-friendly.
